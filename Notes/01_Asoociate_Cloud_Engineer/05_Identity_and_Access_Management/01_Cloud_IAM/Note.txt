*) Cloud IAM:
	-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs
	*) Principle of Least Privilege:
		-> A User, Program, or Process should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform it's function.
		-> EX: if lisa is performing create function on cloud storage bucket where lisa should be restricted to create permission only on exactly one cloud storage bucket.
	-> By using IAM we manage access control by defining who(Identity) has access which is the Role to which resources which also include organizations, folders and projects.
	-> In IAM permission to access resource is not directly granted to the user instead permissions are grouped into roles and the roles are granted to authenticated members.
	-> IAM policies defines and enforces what roles are granted to which members and it's policies are attached to a resource.
	*) Policy Architecture:
		-> Policy is a binding, Audit configurations and metadata.
		-> Binding specifies how access granted on resources.
		-> Metadata include extra information about the policy ex: 'etags', 'version'
		-> Audit specifies the configuration data of how access attempted should be audited.
		*) Members:
			-> './02_Members.PNG'
			-> This is an identity that can access resource.
			-> Identity of an member is an email address associated with the user, service account, google group, domain name.
		*) Roles:
			-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview
			-> This is a names collections of permissions that grant access to perform action on google cloud resources.
			*) Permission:
				-> './03_Permissions.PNG'
				-> Determine what operations are allowed on a resource.
				-> Correspond one-to-one with REST API methods.
				-> Not granted to users directly but grouped together with in that role.
				-> You grant roles which contain one or more permissions
			-> './04_Roles.PNG'
			-> Types of Roles: './05_Roles_Types'
				1. Primitive Roles
				2. Predefined Roles
				3. Custom Roles
		*) Condition:
			-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview
			-> './06_Conditions'
		*) Metadata:
			-> './07_Metadata.PNG'
		*) Audit config:
			-> './08_Audit_Config.PNG'

	*) Policy Inheritance:
		-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/resource-hierarchy-access-control


*) Demo:
	-> https://youtu.be/jpno8FSqpc8?t=17243
	-> here you can add and edit permissions: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam

	*) Add User on You Resources:
		-> https://youtu.be/jpno8FSqpc8?t=18022
		-> You can add new user inside IAM: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
		*) Give storage admin access using cloud shell:
			-> gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_id> --member user:<gmail> --role roles/storage.admin
				-> (This will add new policies on yaml file)
				bindings:
				- members:
  				- serviceAccount:service-<id>@gcp-sa-bms.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  				role: roles/baremetalsolution.serviceAgent
				- members:
  				- serviceAccount:service-<id>@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  				role: roles/compute.serviceAgent
				- members:
  				- serviceAccount:<id>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  				- serviceAccount:<id>@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
  				role: roles/editor
				- members:
  				- user:<gmail>@gmail.com
  				- user:<gmail>@gmail.com
  				role: roles/owner
				- members:
  				- user:<new_add_role_gmail>@gmail.com
  				role: roles/storage.admin
				etag: BwYGL7qlHFo=
				version: 1

	*) Cloud identity: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/cloudidentity/consumer
		-> allow you to manage user and groups
	*) Organizatio policies: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/list
		-> You need to have organizations and need to be a organizations administrator to access this resources
	*) Quotas: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas
		-> Edit any quotas or any of your services
	*) Labels: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/labels
		-> Key value pair that help you organize and filter you resources based on their labels.
		-> EX: if we want to label our virtual machine we can like use:
			-> key: 'environment', values: 'development', 'production', 'testing'
	*) Settings: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/settings
		-> Change project name
	*) Roles: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles
		-> List of all roles and create custom roles.
	*) Audit Logs: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/audit
		-> Set new policy with the Audit Config Logs https://youtu.be/jpno8FSqpc8?t=17680
	*) Groups: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/groups
