*) Cloud IAM:
	-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs
	*) Principle of Least Privilege:
		-> A User, Program, or Process should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform it's function.
		-> EX: if lisa is performing create function on cloud storage bucket where lisa should be restricted to create permission only on exactly one cloud storage bucket.
	-> By using IAM we manage access control by defining who(Identity) has access which is the Role to which resources which also include organizations, folders and projects.
	-> In IAM permission to access resource is not directly granted to the user instead permissions are grouped into roles and the roles are granted to authenticated members.
	-> IAM policies defines and enforces what roles are granted to which members and it's policies are attached to a resource.
	*) Policy Architecture:
		-> Policy is a binding, Audit configurations and metadata.
		-> Binding specifies how access granted on resources.
		-> Metadata include extra information about the policy ex: 'etags', 'version'
		-> Audit specifies the configuration data of how access attempted should be audited.
		*) Members:
			-> './02_Members.PNG'
			-> This is an identity that can access resource.
			-> Identity of an member is an email address associated with the user, service account, google group, domain name.
		*) Roles:
			-> https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview
			-> This is a names collections of permissions that grant access to perform action on google cloud resources.
			*) Permission:
				-> './03_Permissions.PNG'
				-> Determine what operations are allowed on a resource.
				-> Correspond one-to-one with REST API methods.
				-> Not granted to users directly but grouped together with in that role.
				-> You grant roles which contain one or more permissions
			-> './04_Roles.PNG'
			-> Types of Roles: './05_Roles_Types'
				1. Primitive Roles
				2. Predefined Roles
				3. Custom Roles
		*) Condition:

			-> './06_Conditions'
		*) Metadata:
			-> './07_Metadata.PNG'
		*) Audit config:
			-> './08_Audit_Config.PNG'
