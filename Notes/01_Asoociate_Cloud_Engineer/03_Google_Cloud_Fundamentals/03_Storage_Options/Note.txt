*) Storage:
    1. Cloud Storage:
        -> https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs
        -> Object storage
        -> This is not the type of storage that you would attach to you instances and store you operating system on.
        -> Here we are managing data as objects like: documents, pictures etc...
        -> It is not like a block storage where you can store OS.

    2. FileStore
        -> If you want to access the same data using Multiple instances and kubernetes clusters in that case we can use FileStore
    
    3. Persistent Disks:
        -> Used as a drives for instances.
